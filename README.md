# neetcode-jl

This repo contains solutions to NeetCode.io problems written in the Julia programming language, which are solved in python, C++, Java, and a range of other leetcode supported languages at https://github.com/neetcode-gh/leetcode.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing. Although Julia is not currently supported on LeetCode, it is a great language for solving algorithmic problems.

This repo aims to provide solutions and explanations for LeetCode problems in Julia, as a learning resource for those interested in Julia and practicing algorithmic problem solving.

## Contents
